				<h2>Background</h2>
				<p>I, Barun Kuinkel an active youth of age 18, completed my high school degree from the Kathmandu Unified City College in the faculty of management choosing Computer Science as the major subject, where I gained lots of knowledge and skills beyond the syllabus. I got helped from the teachers and the professor who shows the right path to reach the ultimate goal.

As I am peer educator and youth advocate in the field of Sexual Reproductive Health and Rights.

				<h2>As a Developeer</h2>
				<p> Talking about my experience as web developer it was a bit difficult in the very beginning for me as the html and css was completely the new topic for me. Later on, with the help of tutor and self-study makes me capable of creating web page. Now I can create smooth and attractive design by using various css properties. There are lots of properties I have learned during this first semester. It’s my great achievement. During the semester I had learned both html tags and css properties. Html gives the outline for the web page that means it contain all the information where as css is used to make the design more efficient, attractive, and smooth. All the content is mainly created under body tag where we can create navigation, different side bar, section, footer, etc. Almost most of the important content comes under it. But in the header also we can create navigation and break it into different blocks. </p>
